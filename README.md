# Codility Helper

This is a small automation app which helps preparing interviews at Microsoft. If you are not a Microsoft employee, you won't be able to use this tool.

This app is used to create several codility sessions with the same coding task. It may be useful when you know that you need to conduct for example 5 interviews. You need 5 codility sessions for this. It is better to use independent sessions as candidates will have the exact same conditions.

The app relies on:
* you are using a domain enrolled PC;
* you have Edge installed;
* you have used https://mscodilityhelper.azurewebsites.net/ earlier. *Here I am a bit unsure. Let me know if you have never used it and the app worked for you.*

## How to use

1. Grab installer from release sections.
2. Install.
3. Run `CodilityHelper`.
4. Paste your coding challenge, select desired programming language and the number of sessions to create.
5. Click `Run` button.
6. You will see a browser window opened and automated.
7. As an output you will get URLs to codility sessions with corresponding access codes.
